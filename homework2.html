        <h2>Programming Exercise 2</h2>
         <p>Write your own function to animate the position of an image up and down or left to right on the screen. When the image fully disappears from one end of the screen, its bottom (or right side, depending on what directionality you choose) should appear from the other end, as if the screen is a cyclical object. Use our in-class fade example as a reference as well as w3schools animation page:</p>
             <p>Create a button that upon being pressed calls a function that chooses a random image from your folder and replaces this image with the current one.</p>
        <p>Extra features include: button styling, dropdown:hover; properties, and cursor: pointer; properties.</p>
